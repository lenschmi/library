Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript Path Library Project.

The project description can be found [HERE](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). This mini project was meant to provide some practice using objects, object constructors and prototypes in JavaScript and was done after completing this [lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/objects-and-object-constructors).

**Project Notes**
- This project was fun to think about since I read a lot and use [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) for tracking my books. This made me think a bit about what might have gone into such a website.
- To add multiple books quickly call addTestBooks(n) from the console (where n is the number of books to add)
- The layout of the book cards was done using a CSS flexbox and some invisible dummy books. I'm not happy with this implementation and will probably change it to a grid.
- The stats pane has not yet been implemented.
- I implemented storage of user books in local storage, but have not yet added Firebase support. The curriculum hasn't yet covered any other data storage techniques.
- I added a filter feature that allows for filtering on read or unread books. If you add books the filter is removed.


**TO DO**
- Update flexbox layout to grid
- Add Firebase support
- Include a CSS reset file
- Add statistics to left pane
